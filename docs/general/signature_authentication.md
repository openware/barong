# Signature Authentication

## How to configure

To enable endpoint which provides you signature authentication, you need to set `BARONG_AUTH_METHODS` ENV to `signature` </br>
If you need to have usual password and signature authentication your env value should look like this `password,signature`

## API Endpoint explanation

Today, system support signature authentication generated only by Polkadot </br>

API call which provides you ability to login with signature `POST /api/v2/barong/identity/sessions/signature` </br>

Please make sure your signature was generated this (way)[https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring/start/sign-verify/] </br>

Be aware, that system supports only signatures generated by `ED25519` algorithm </br>

Also, please be aware that you should use `nonce` param in milliseconds. You can use barong API endpoint to get current server time `GET /api/v2/barong/identity/time`, where `time_ms` - your time in milliseconds and `time` - server current unix timestamp in seconds </br>

System will check nonce expiration by this ENV variable `BARONG_APIKEY_NONCE_LIFETIME`, by default value is `5000` ms (it means that if your nonce was generated more than 5s ago, system will reject such nonce), if you want to have different time for nonce lifetime, you can configure it changing this env value</br>
